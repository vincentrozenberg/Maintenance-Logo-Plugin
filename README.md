# Maintenance Logo Plugin

A simple WordPress plugin that displays a custom logo on your site during maintenance mode. The logo is centred on the screen, and its size automatically adjusts to fit within 50% of the viewport's width.

## Features

- **Custom Logo**: Easily set a custom logo URL via the WordPress admin panel.
- **Responsive Design**: The logo scales to fit within the viewport while maintaining its aspect ratio.
- **User-Friendly**: Automatically displays the maintenance logo to non-admin users while allowing admins to access the backend.
- **Simple On/Off**: Plugin on? Maintance page on. Plugin off? Maintance page off. No need to keep unused plugins on.


## Installation

1. **Download** or clone the repository to your WordPress plugins directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/maintenance-logo-plugin.git
